# jQuery Effects

## Challange 1

### Instructions:

Edit your html file to change all the &lt;a&gt; tags to &lt;button&gt; elements. Donâ€™t forget the closing tag and to remove the href attribute. Make the first button hide when clicked.

On the same button, try the slow, medium, fast, and a number in milliseconds (you will need to refresh to get the button back).
